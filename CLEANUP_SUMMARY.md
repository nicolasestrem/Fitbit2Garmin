# Codebase Cleanup Summary

This document outlines the results of a codebase review and the subsequent cleanup actions performed to improve code quality, remove inconsistencies, and eliminate redundant files.

## 1. Initial Review Findings

The initial review of the codebase revealed several key issues:

*   **Architectural Inconsistency:** The primary project documentation (`GEMINI.md`) described a Python FastAPI backend. However, the project's configuration (`wrangler.toml`) and the presence of a `frontend/functions` directory clearly indicated that the application is deployed as a serverless application on Cloudflare Pages/Functions, not as a Python backend.
*   **Redundant Directories:**
    *   `archives/`: This directory contained outdated and archived documentation, including a duplicate `GEMINI.md` file.
    *   `tested/`: This directory held a standalone Python script (`convert_json_to_fit.py`) which was an early, non-production version of the conversion logic. The functionality was superseded by the Cloudflare Functions implementation.
    *   `backend/`: The entire Python FastAPI application in this directory was obsolete and unused, as the project had migrated to a Cloudflare Functions architecture.
*   **Unused Test Files:** The root directory contained test data files (`weight-2024-03-21.json`, `Weight 38-2024 Fitbit.fit`) that were not part of the application's source code.
*   **Unused Frontend Dependencies:** An analysis of the frontend application's `package.json` and source code identified two unused dependencies:
    *   `@headlessui/react`
    *   `web-vitals`

## 2. Cleanup Actions Performed

Based on the findings, the following actions were taken to clean up the codebase:

1.  **Removed Redundant Directories:**
    *   Deleted the `archives/` directory.
    *   Deleted the `tested/` directory.
    *   Deleted the `backend/` directory.
2.  **Removed Test Files:** Deleted `weight-2024-03-21.json` and `Weight 38-2024 Fitbit.fit` from the project root.
3.  **Updated Documentation:** The main `GEMINI.md` file was completely rewritten to accurately reflect the current Cloudflare Functions-based architecture and remove all incorrect references to the old Python backend.

## 3. Next Steps

The final step in this cleanup process is to remove the identified unused dependencies from the frontend application. This will be done by running `npm uninstall @headlessui/react web-vitals` in the `frontend` directory.

## Conclusion

These changes have resulted in a cleaner, more consistent, and smaller codebase. The project now has accurate documentation that matches its implementation, and all obsolete and redundant code has been removed.
