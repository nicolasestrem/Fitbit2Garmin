# Example environment configuration for the Fitbit2Garmin frontend.
# Copy this file to `.env` and adjust values as needed.

# Override the backend API URL when running the UI against a different
# server during local development. Leave unset to use the same origin's
# "/api" path exposed by the dev proxy.
# Examples:
#   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
#   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://staging.example.com/api
REACT_APP_API_URL=
