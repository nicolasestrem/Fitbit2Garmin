# Example environment configuration for the Fitbit2Garmin frontend.
# Copy this file to `.env` and adjust values as needed.

# Override the backend API URL when running the UI against a different
# server during local development. Leave unset to use the same origin's
# "/api" path (served by Cloudflare Pages Functions in production).
# Examples:
#   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
#   VITE_API_URL=https://your-pages-site.pages.dev/api
VITE_API_URL=
